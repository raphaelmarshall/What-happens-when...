This pull request adds a comprehensive explanation of what happens when you type "https://www.google.com" and press enter in your browse

1. DNS Request:
Domain Name System (DNS) servers act as a phonebook for the internet, containing a database of public IP addresses associated with website names. In our case, the browser sends a query to a DNS server to translate the human-readable domain name "www.google.com" into its corresponding IP address. This step is crucial for locating the web server that hosts Google’s website.

2. TCP/IP :

With the IP address obtained from the DNS lookup, your browser initiates a TCP/IP connection with the web server. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) ensures reliable communication by breaking data into packets and handling retransmissions if necessary, while Internet Protocol(IP) facilitates routing and delivery of these packets across the internet.

3. Firewall:

a firewall is a security barrier designed to monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic. Before reaching the web server, your request may pass through a firewall that examines the request to ensure it compiles with predefined security policies, protecting against unauthorized access and potential threats.

4. HTTPS/SSL:

Since you specified “https://” in the URL, the browser engages in an HTTP connection with the web server. Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure(HTTPS) encrypts the data exchanged between your browser and the server, safeguarding it from eavesdropping and tampering. The encryption is established through the Secure Socket Layer(SSL) or Transport Layer Security(TLS) protocol, which involves a handshake process to authenticate the server’s identity and negotiate encryption parameters.

5. Load Balancer:

In the case of high-traffic websites like Google and TikTok, incoming requests may be distributed across multiple servers to optimize performance and ensure scalability. A load balancer acts as a traffic manager, evenly distributing incoming requests among a pool of servers based on factors like server health and current load.

6. Web Server:

Upon receiving your request, the web server processes it and generates an appropriate response. This may involve retrieving static content or dynamically generating HTML based on various factors such as your location, language, preferences, and search history. Google’s web servers are highly optimized to handle millions of requests efficiently, utilizing advanced caching mechanisms and content delivery networks (CDNs) to reduce latency and improve responsiveness.

7. Application Server:

For dynamic web applications or personalized content, the web server may interact with an application server. The application server executes server-side code, such as PHP, Python, or Java, to process user requests, retrieve data from databases, and generate dynamic content on the fly. In Google’s case, sophisticated algorithms and data processing systems are employed to deliver personalized search results and services tailored to each user.

8. Database:

Behind the scenes, your request may trigger queries to a database to retrieve relevant information or update records. Databases play a crucial role in storing and managing vast amounts of structured data, powering various features and services offered by Google, such as search indexing, user profiles, and advertising targeting
